# üß† AutoRecruit: Intelligent Resume-to-Interview Pipeline

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Enter the sender email and sender app password in `scheduler_agent.py` for the system to send emails properly.**

This project is a multi-agent, AI-driven recruitment automation system designed to streamline candidate evaluation, job matching, and scheduling ‚Äî all while ensuring **data privacy with on-premise technologies**.

---

## üöÄ Overview

The system automates and optimizes the hiring process using four intelligent agents:

- **Qualification Agent**: Extracts job requirements from descriptions and structures them for comparison.
- **CV Agent**: Processes candidate resumes and generates structured profiles.
- **Matching Agent**: Calculates a semantic match score between job descriptions and resumes.
- **Scheduler Agent**: Sends interview invites to top-matched candidates securely via email.
